Ethernet HDL project.
## Description
This project's goal is to create a silicon independent TCP/IP implementation. 
## Features
- Functional TCP/IP stack capable of listening and connecting;
- SACK-capable (tx and rx);
- ARP table and request/reply;
- ICMP reply (ping);
- DHCP client;
- 1-Gbit RGMII MAC (8-bit datapath).
## Limitations
- No compliance to RFC;
- Low tx and rx buffer sizes (only on-chip RAM used);
- Static RTO;
- Only 1 connection per instance;
- Limited simulation and hardware tests.
## Project file structure
- `src`. Source files for synthesis;
- `sim`. Source files for simulation;
- `tb`. Testbench location;
- `hw`. Hardware examples;
- `hdl_generics`. Submodule containing generic HDL components

# How to use
To use this core with, you'll need a 10/100/1000 Mbit GMII/RGMII capable PHY. One popular example is Realtek RTL8211 which doesn't even need any MDIO configuration to work. The top-level entity is `eth_vlg` described in `eth_vlg.sv`. User data stream connection is provided via `tcp_xxx`. The control and status lines are also there. Please note that TCP becomes avaliable only after DHCP has either succeeded or failed to obtain an IP address.
## Clocking
The design is clocked by two (possibly asynchronous) 125MHz clocks: the one for receive path is provided by PHY itself as part of RGMII/GMII interface `phy_rx_clk`. The second clock is used for internal logic `clk`.
### Receive path
Any clock-to-data skew is possible as the PLL in receive path allows for arbitrary phase shift. The receive clock provided by PHY is used only as receive PLL reference clock. All logic is clocked by the receive PLL's output. The PLL is used to align data to clock for correct timing. This clock drives the input ddr i/o primitives used for RGMII and the write port of CDC FIFO.
### Clock domain crossing
Clock domain crossing is handled by `mac_vlg_cdc`. GMII signals are written to CDC FIFO containing true dual-port RAM in receive clock domain. All GMII signals: data, valid and error are passed through this FIFO. These signals are being read out from the FIFO to `clk` domain. The readout begins a few ticks after `empty` flag of the FIFO goes low and stops when `empty` goes high again. This delay is introduced to be sure that there is always at least one unread byte in FIFO (seen from read side) while the packet is being simultaneously written and read. If the readout clock is faster then the write clock, there may be some packet tearing from the read side because the FIFO will be read out faster then written to. Not that `clk` being a bit slower then `phy_rx_clk` does not pose a problem as the excessive unread bytes will be stacked in FIFO and read properly without interruptions in `valid` signal.
### Transmit path
The clock for transmit path is also shifted by PLL to meet timing requrements for PHY. Reference clock for the tx PLL is supplied externally. If no 125MHz clocks are present on the PCB, one can generate two 125MHz clocks: one for internal use and the other for `phy_gtx_clk`. 
### SDC and tuning
Sample `constaints.sdc` is supplied with Cyclone 10 LP Evaluation Kit example project: `hw/c10lp_eval_kit/src/`. Firstly, PLL clocks are defined with desired phase shifts. It's important to note that the actual synthesys parameters of PLLs are set in `rgmii_rx_pll.v` and `rgmii_rx_pll.v` located in `hw/c10lp_eval_kit/ip/`. The `altpll_component.clk0_phase_shift` sets the phase shift in ns units (unlike degrees in .sdc). A warning will appear in Quartus if there parameters do not match. It is clear that rx and tx timing analysis are separated by means of `set_clock_groups -asynchronous`. The rx constraints are described using virtual clock. It may be necessary to empirically set the rx and tx PLL's phase shift to achieve stable data latching and timing requrements of PHY.

## Hello world
Sample project is provided targeting Cyclone 10 LP EvaluationpKit. The project implements ESG protocol over TCP/IP. The logic is connected to onboard LEDs D6-D9.
Default IP is 192.168.0.213 if no DHCP server is on LAN. TCP port is 1000. After establishing a TCP connection with PuTTY or other tools, type:
```
`ver;
```
You should get a string response containing version and build date. 
Note: be sure to check `Raw` in connection type field if using PuTTY.

## Simulation
Simple testbench is provided to verify functionality. Run modelsim.bat inside `tb` folder. (modelsim.exe location should be in PATH)
2 modules are instantiated, for client and server. After DHCP sequence and ARP, 3-way handshake is performed and TCP data is streamed in both directions.
## Testing
The code was compiled with for
- Cyclone V (5CEBA5) -8 speed grade with Texas Instruments DP83867IR PHY (Quartus 17.1) on a custom PCB.
- Cyclone 10 LP -8 speed grade with RTL8211 PHY (Quartus 18.0) using QMTech Cyclone 10LP development kit.
Both failed timing, although worked as expected. Changing speed grade to -7 fixed timing.
## Compiling (Intel)
You can manually specify target FPGA family, part and flash memory used in create_prj.tcl.
```
set FamilyDev "Cyclone V"
set PartDev "5CEBA5F23C8"
set MemDev "EPCS64"
set FlashLoadDev "5CEBA5"
```
The pins are modified in pins.tcl.

To compile an example project, run complete_flow.bat. (quartus.exe location should be in PATH).
